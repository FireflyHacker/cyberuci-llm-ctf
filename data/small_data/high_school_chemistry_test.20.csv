"There are a number of experiments for the determination of the molecular mass of a gas. One method begins by heating a solid or liquid in a flask to produce a gaseous product. The gas passes through a tube and displaces water in an inverted, water-filled bottle.

The pressure in the inverted water-filled bottle is equal to the external pressure. Once the barometric pressure has been recorded, what other information is needed to finish the experiment?",The heat of formation of the gas,The density of the water,The mass of the displaced water,The vapor pressure of the water,D
