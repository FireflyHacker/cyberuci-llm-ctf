"Larry was passing by a house under construction when he noticed that the ladder being used by workers on the roof had copper braces supporting the rungs. After making sure that the workers on the roof could not see him, Larry used a pliers that he had in his pocket to remove all of the copper braces that he could reach from the ground. A short time later, Vernon climbed down the ladder and it collapsed. He fell to the ground and severely injured his back. Larry was apprehended a few hours later trying to sell the copper for scrap. A statute in the jurisdiction makes it a felony for ""maliciously causing serious physical injury to another."" Larry was charged with malicious injury under the statute and was also charged with larceny. After a jury trial in which the above facts were presented, he was convicted of both charges. If Larry appeals the conviction for the malicious injury charge on grounds of insufficient evidence, how should the court rule?","Affirm the conviction, because Larry was engaged in criminal conduct at the time of the act that resulted in the injury.","Affirm the conviction, because the jury could have found that Larry acted with malice.","Reverse the conviction, because there was no evidence that Larry intended to injure anyone.","Reverse the conviction, because there was no evidence that Larry bore any malice towards Vernon or the other workers on the roof.",B
"Oswald owned an old, unoccupied, and extremely run-down building in Hooverville. The walls were unstable and beginning to buckle. Oswald knew of the building's condition, but he did not want to spend the money needed to repair it and hoped that the Hooverville Redevelopment Commission would want his land to build a shopping mall. Timmy was a driver for U-Pump-It Tanker Lines, a concern that operated tanker trucks that delivered gasoline to filling stations. U-PumpIt's rules required drivers to park only in legally designated parking areas. After completing his deliveries for the day in Hooverville, Timmy stopped for a cup of coffee. He did not want to spend time trying to find a parking place on a side street, so he parked in front of Oswald's building, which was located on a through street. The area in front of Oswald's building was clearly marked, ""No Parking At Any Time."" Timmy walked to the Emporium Restaurant, where he ordered coffee and the daily special. Hooverville was located in an area subject to minor earthquake activity. Just as Timmy began his lunch, a quake jolted Hooverville. The quake was not strong enough to cause damage to structurally sound buildings, but was sufficient to cause the walls of Oswald's building to collapse. The building fell on top of the U-Pump-It truck, causing the truck to roll over on its side. Gasoline leaked from the truck and began streaming down the street. Elvira, a pedestrian walking two blocks away, lit a cigarette and casually tossed a match in the street. The stream of gasoline had just reached that street and the match caused the gasoline to ignite. The flames spread to a nearby commercial building. An explosion occurred, causing many windows in a neighboring apartment building to be blown inward. Flying glass was propelled into Bonnie's apartment. Bonnie suffered multiple cuts and a serious eye injury from the flying glass. Bonnie brings a negligence action against UPump-It Tanker Lines. If the court finds in favor of U-Pump-It, it will be because: ",The court follows the Cardozo view regarding foreseeable plaintiffs.,Timmy was acting outside the scope of his employment when Bonnie was injured.,Oswald was the legal cause of Bonnie's injuries because his building was in an unreasonably dangerous condition.,The company had a rule against illegal parking on streets.,A
"Assume for the purposes of this question that you are counsel to the state legislative committee that is responsible for real estate laws in your state. The committee wants you to $\mathrm{draft}$ legislation to make all restrictions on land use, imposed by deeds (now or hereafter recorded), unenforceable in the future so that public landuse planning through zoning will have exclusive control in matters of land use. Which of the following is least likely to be a consideration in the drafting of such legislation?",Compensation for property rights taken by public authority.,Impairment of contract.,Sovereign immunity.,Police power.,C
"The city of West Rabbit's Foot, which lies astride a major interstate highway, recently passed a referendum declaring itself to be a ""nuclear free zone."" The referendum included a provision making criminal any importation of specified nuclear materials into the city limits. The law was immediately challenged in federal court by an interstate trucking firm which regularly transported prohibited nuclear materials through West Rabbit's Foot on the highway. The case ultimately reached the United States Supreme Court, which held in a 5-4 decision that the challenged ordinance was constitutional because the city had a rational basis for concluding that the citizens of West Rabbit's Foot would be safer if the prohibited materials were kept outside of town, and because the ordinance did not unduly burden interstate commerce. Many other towns and cities throughout the nation considered similar enactments after the Supreme Court decision was announced. You are a lobbyist hired by the trucking industry to persuade Congress that a federal statute prohibiting the state regulation of interstate transportation of nuclear materials must immediately be enacted. Congress member Bluster has tentatively agreed to sponsor such legislation, but wants to know whether such a federal statute would pass constitutional muster. You should advise Bluster that the proposed statute would probably be held:","Unconstitutional, since the Supreme Court has already ruled that local governments may prohibit specified nuclear materials from crossing their borders.","Unconstitutional, because the disparate treatment of interstate versus intrastate carriers of nuclear materials would violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.","Constitutional, because Congress has plenary power to regulate interstate commerce.","Constitutional, because the Supremacy Clause requires that state enactments bow to conflicting federal legislation.",C
"Darren's car was stopped by Officer Jones for a minor traffic violation. The officer recognized Darren as a suspect in a multimillion-dollar bank fraud scheme that had just been discovered by the authorities. She placed Darren under arrest and gave him Miranda warnings. She then asked for permission to search the trunk of the car. Darren nodded and unlocked the trunk. Officer Jones searched the trunk and discovered a bag containing what appeared to be cocaine in a compartment in the trunk. When later tests determined that it was cocaine, the authorities added a charge of transporting illegal narcotics to Darren's indictment. At a preliminary hearing, Darren moved to have evidence of the cocaine excluded as the result of a search in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Should the court grant Darren's motion?","Yes, because one taken into custody cannot give valid consent to a search that would otherwise require a warrant.","Yes, because the search exceeded the scope of a permissible search incident to a lawful arrest.","No, if the court finds that Darren's consent was voluntary under the circumstances.","No, because persons have a lesser expectation of privacy in their vehicles for purposes of the Fourth Amendment.",C

"With an election approaching, Congress passed a statute requiring that all full-time employees, including state and municipal employees, be paid overtime for any work over 40 hours per week, or be otherwise compensated through time off or vacation time. Patchquilt was a municipality located in a very warm climate. Many Patchquilt residents were on welfare, and the town contained no major industry or shopping district to bolster its tax base. Patchquilt employed only three refuse collectors and asserted reasonably that it could not afford to hire more. However, during the warmest times of the year, extra refuse collections were routine because of the city council's fear that rotting garbage in the hot climate could contribute to the spread of disease. During the hottest months, the three refuse collectors in Patchquilt regularly worked well beyond the 40 hours per week standard. Because of normal vacation time and the normally heavy garbage collection schedule, it would not be possible to give the refuse collectors additional time off during the cooler months, which were not always very cool, without hiring additional refuse collectors. Patchquilt brings an action in federal district court, asserting that the federal statute requiring overtime pay to municipal workers is unconstitutional. The court should hold the statute: ","Constitutional, as a reasonable application of the Necessary and Proper Clause.","Constitutional, because regulation of state and local employees is within the ambit of federal power over interstate commerce.","Unconstitutional, because regulation of state and local employees is an issue reserved to the states.","Unconstitutional, because the state police power to promote health and safety precludes federal action in this case.

"Paulsen was eating in a restaurant when he began to choke on a piece of food that had lodged in his throat. Dow, a physician who was sitting at a nearby table, did not wish to become involved and did not render any assistance, although prompt medical attention would have been effective in removing the obstruction from Paulsen's throat. Because of the failure to obtain prompt medical attention, Paulsen suffered severe brain injury from lack of oxygen. If Paulsen asserts a claim against Dow for his injuries, will Paulsen prevail?","Yes, if the jurisdiction relieves physicians of malpractice liability for emergency first aid.","Yes, if a reasonably prudent person with Dow's experience, training, and knowledge would have assisted Paulsen.","No, because Dow was not responsible for Paulsen's condition.","No, unless Dow knew that Paulsen was substantially certain to sustain serious injury.",C
"According to a statute of the state of Kiowa, a candidate for state office may have his name placed on the official election ballot only if he files with the appropriate state official a petition containing a specified number of voter signatures. Roderick failed to get his name placed on the state ballot as an independent candidate for governor because he failed to file a petition with the number of voter signatures required by state statute. In a suit against the appropriate state officials in federal district court, Roderick sought an injunction against the petition signature requirement on the ground that it was unconstitutional. Which of the following, if established, constitutes the strongest argument for Roderick?",Compliance with the petition signature requirement is burdensome.,The objectives of the statute could be satisfactorily achieved by less burdensome means.,"Because of the petition signature requirement, very few independent candidates have ever succeeded in getting on the ballot.",The motivation for the statute was a desire to keep candidates off the ballot if they did not have strong support among voters. ,B
"Due to intense foreign competition in the domestic market and other adverse economic conditions, the domestic manufacturers of horse liniment formed a trade association, the American Horse Liniment Institute (""AHLI""), whose main purpose was to lobby Congress for tariff protection and for grants-in-aid to modernize their plants, which everyone agreed were less efficient than those of their Asian and European competitors. Congress passed legislation providing some degree of protection from foreign competition and appropriating 200 million dollars for grants-in-aid to domestic horse liniment manufacturers. However, because of concern about inefficiencies in the industry, the legislation was amended to allow the Secretary of Commerce to deny grants to horse liniment manufacturers who failed to meet certain ""management efficiency standards"" outlined in the legislation. Lum \& Bagel Co., a liniment manufacturer and a member of AHLI, petitioned the Secretary of Commerce for a $15 million grant, the amount to which Lum \& Bagel would be entitled under the legislation, based upon the number of its employees and plants and upon its average production of horse liniment over a 10-year period. The Secretary of Commerce refused to award funds to Lum \& Bagel, because she determined that Lum \& Bagel was making no attempt to improve its management efficiency. Lum \& Bagel filed suit against the Secretary of Commerce, asserting that the power granted to the Secretary was unconstitutional. Is the legislation constitutional?","Yes, because the Secretary of Commerce, as a representative of the executive branch, may be granted regulatory authority.","Yes, because the executive branch, represented by the Secretary of Commerce, shares power with Congress in the field of foreign commerce.","No, because there was an improper delegation of legislative power.","No, because the executive branch may not impound funds appropriated by Congress.

In its case-in-chief, the prosecution seeks to offer evidence that Donald, who was arrested several days after the crime, had been caught with 50 grams of cocaine in his car. This evidence will most likely be:","Inadmissible, because Donald has not offered evidence of good character.","Inadmissible, because it has limited probative value and is unduly prejudicial.","Admissible, because it tends to show what Donald did with the money he stole.","Admissible, because it tends to show that Donald is capable of committing serious crimes.",B
"Olman expected the value of property near Middletown to increase substantially. To buy a tract known as Blueacre, Olman secured a $ 10,000$ mortgage on Blueacre from Exbank. After completing the purchase, Olman wished to make certain improvements on Blueacre. To finance them, Olman took out a $ 2,000$ second mortgage on Blueacre from Wybank. Both mortgages were promptly and properly recorded. Before Olman made a payment on either mortgage, the federal government announced that it would begin storing nuclear waste products in the Middletown area. The value of property, including Blueacre, plummeted. Olman did not pay either Exbank or Wybank. Exbank brought a proper action to foreclose, notifying both Olman and Wybank.

"Dassent was on trial on a hit and run charge, whereby the prosecution asserts that, while driving his vehicle, Dassent struck and injured Proctor, an elderly pedestrian, and then sped away from the scene of the accident without stopping to assess Proctor's injuries or to render assistance. During the prosecution's presentation of its case, three eyewitnesses testified that the car that struck Proctor had the license plate number DASS 53. A witness from the State Department of Motor Vehicles produced records showing that a vehicle with license number DASS 53 was registered in Dassent's name and that Dassent claimed on his driver's license application that he was born in 1953. Dassent took the stand in his own defense. He admitted that a car meeting the description of the vehicle given by the eyewitnesses and bearing a license plate with the number DASS 53 belonged to him, but Dassent denied having driven the vehicle on the day that Proctor was injured. Without releasing Dassent as a witness, his lawyer called Father White, an Episcopal priest, to the stand. White is ready to testify that he has known Dassent for 12 years, that Dassent has performed many charitable acts, and that Dassent is a highly responsible person ""who would not run away from his obligations by leaving the scene of an accident."" If the prosecution objects to White's proposed testimony, should the court bar White from testifying?","No, because the testimony shows that Dassent is a person of good character.","No, because the testimony is habit evidence tending to show that it was unlikely that Dassent was the perpetrator.","Yes, because one may not use character evidence to bolster one's own testimony.","Yes, because the prosecution has not made an issue of Dassent's character.",A
