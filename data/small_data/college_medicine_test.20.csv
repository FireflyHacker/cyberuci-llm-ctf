"A police officer carries out hundreds of traffic stops every year. When his supervisor is reviewing the officer’s records for the past year, he notices that the officer is equally likely to stop people of various genders, ages, and races. However, he is significantly more likely to write tickets for middle-aged white males with dark hair and eyes. When confronted with this fact, the officer truthfully states that he has no idea why that is, and that it must simply be a coincidence. Unbeknownst to the officer, this behavior is tied to the fact that these men look like his father, with whom he had an abusive relationship as a child. What psychological framework would directly address the unconscious bias in his behavior? ",Behaviorist,Psychoanalytic,Cognitive behavioral,Humanistic,B

"A psychologist conducts an experiment in which subjects are asked to learn a series of “facts” which are actually statements that have been fabricated by the research team. The subjects consist of undergraduate students at the university where the experiment is being conducted. The subjects are randomly assigned to groups that are compensated either $10 or $20 for their participation, are given either 15 minutes or 30 minutes to learn the facts, and are asked to recall the facts either in the same room in which they learned the facts or in a very different, unfamiliar setting. Which of the following are dependent variables in this experiment?
I. The amount the subjects were compensated.
II. The room in which the subjects were asked to recall facts.
III. The number of facts the subjects can recall.
IV. The time the subjects were given to learn the facts.",II only,III only,I and IV only,I and III and IV only,B

"Myoclonic epilepsy and ragged-red fiber (MERRF) is an extremely rare disorder that affects neuromuscular systems. MERRF results from a mutation in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) that impairs protein synthesis, oxygen consumption, and energy production.

"A scientist, using electrodes, is stimulating a group of neurons in the hypothalamus and recording their membrane potential changes. She observes a sharp rise in membrane potential when she first stimulates them, the the difference of 100mV. When she tries another stimulation immediately after the first, there is no response. However, when she increase the amount of voltage she supplies to the second shock, she observes a similar response to the first. What time period of stimulation would the second shock be characterized in regards to membrane potential?",Depolarization,Repolarization,Hyperpolarization,Resting potential,C
