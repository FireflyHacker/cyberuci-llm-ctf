How does a buffer overflow on the stack facilitate running attacker-injected code?,By overwriting the return address to point to the location of that code,By writing directly to the instruction pointer register the address of the code,By writing directly to %eax the address of the code,"By changing the name of the running executable, stored on the stack",A

"Suppose Unix did not provide a way of passing file descriptors between processes, but still allowed inheriting file descriptors from a parent on fork and exec. What aspects of the OKWS design would break without file descriptor passing?
1. It would be impossible for services to send messages to oklogd.
2. It would be impossible for services to get a TCP connection to a database proxy.","True, True","False, False","True, False","False, True",B
In MD-5 the length of the message digest is,160,128,64,54,B
"In Brumley and Boneh’s paper on side-channel attacks, why does blinding prevent the timing attack from working?","Blinding prevents the server from using the CRT optimization, which is essential to the timing attack.","Blinding changes the p and q primes that are used, so an adversary cannot learn the server’s true p and q values.","Blinding randomizes the ciphertext being decrypted, thus obscuring the correlation between an adversary’s input and the timing differences.","Blinding adds a random amount of time to the decryption due to the multiplication and division by the blinding random value r, which obscures the timing differences used in the attack.",C
___________________ began to show up few years back on wireless access points as a new way of adding or connecting new devices.,WPA2,WPA,WPS,WEP,C
Why would a ping sweep be used?,To identify live systems,To locate live systems,To identify open ports,To locate firewalls,A
Which among them has the strongest wireless security?,WEP,WPA,WPA2,WPA3,D
"When does a buffer overflow occur, generally speaking?",when writing to a pointer that has been freed,when copying a buffer from the stack to the heap,when a pointer is used to access memory not allocated to it,"when the program notices a buffer has filled up, and so starts to reject requests",C
"Encryption and decryption provide secrecy, or condentiality, but not",Authentication,Integrity,Privacy,All of the above,B
An integer overflow occurs when,"an integer expression's result ""wraps around""; instead of creating a very large number, a very small (or negative) number ends up getting created",an integer is used as if it was a pointer,an integer is used to access a buffer outside of the buffer's bounds,there is no more space to hold integers in the program,D
A special tool is necessary for entering the network which is _______________ that helps the anonymous internet users to access into the Tor’s network and use various Tor services.,Opera browser,Firefox,Chrome,Tor browser,D
Statement 1| A U2F USB dongle prevents malware on the user’s computer from stealing the user’s second factor to authenticate as that user even when the user’s computer is turned off. Statement 2| A server using U2F can reliably determine that the user who is attempting to login is indeed behind the computer that sent the login request.,"True, True","False, False","True, False","False, True",C
A __________ is a sequential segment of the memory location that is allocated for containing some data such as a character string or an array of integers.,stack,queue,external storage,buffer,D
Which of the following is true of mutation-based fuzzing?,It generates each different input by modifying a prior input,It works by making small mutations to the target program to induce faults,Each input is mutation that follows a given grammar,"It only makes sense for file-based fuzzing, not network-based fuzzing",A
Which of the following is not a security exploit?,Eavesdropping,Cross-site scripting,Authentication,SQL Injection,C
