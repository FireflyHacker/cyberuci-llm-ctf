"Bernaise, the sole proprietor of Bernaise Distributors, a food service and food brokerage concern, entered into oral negotiations with Hollandaise, president and chief executive officer of Holsauce, a corporation that manufactured gourmet food products for restaurants and select retail outlets. Bernaise wished to secure an exclusive distributorship for Holsauce products in the six New England states. After some discussion, Bernaise and Hollandaise agreed on all salient points and shook hands on the deal. They agreed further that Hobson, Holsauce's general counsel, would reduce the agreement to writing and that the agreement would become effective after it was drawn up and initialed by Hobson and by Barker, Bernaise's counsel. Hobson duly committed the agreement to writing and sent the writing to Barker, but without initialing it first. Barker looked over the agreement, made no changes, initialed it, and mailed the agreement to Hobson on May 1. On May 2, Hollandaise decided that Bechamel would be a better distributor than Bernaise. Therefore, also on May 2, Hollandaise had Hobson telephone Barker, telling him, ""The deal's off."" Barker responded, ""The heck it is. We have an enforceable contract."" Hobson received the written agreement with Barker's initials on it on May 3. According to Hollandaise's instructions, Holsauce began to distribute its products in New England through Bechamel. If Bernaise files suit against Hollandaise and Holsauce for breach, he is likely to:","Prevail, because the mailing of the written agreement to Barker constituted an irrevocable offer.","Prevail, because Bernaise and Hollandaise entered into a valid oral contract.","Not prevail, because Hobson never initialed the written agreement and there was, therefore, failure of an express condition.","Not prevail, because Hobson's phone call to Barker constituted a valid revocation before acceptance.",B
"Stone operated a newsstand on leased space in an office building. On March 15, Quinn purchased the office building and told Stone that he wanted to negotiate a new lease. During the negotiations, Stone and Quinn orally agreed that Stone would have the exclusive right to sell newspapers and magazines in the office building. Quinn prepared a written lease outlining the Stone-Quinn agreement, but forgot to include the agreement that Stone would have exclusive rights in the office building. Stone was given a copy of the lease to read, but Stone merely glanced over the lease because he assumed it reflected his agreement with Quinn. Stone then signed the lease, which included a merger and integration clause. On March 30, Quinn leased space to Jacobs for the establishment of a drug store to be run by Jacobs. The Quinn-Jacobs lease did not prevent Jacobs from selling newspapers or magazines. As a result of the competition, Stone lost substantial profits in his business. Stone brings suit to reform the contract to reflect his exclusive right to sell newspapers and magazines in the office building. The most likely result of this suit is that:",Stone will prevail.,Stone will prevail only if he can prove a mutual mistake.,Stone will not prevail because of the application of the parol evidence rule.,Stone will not prevail because the mistake on his part was unilateral.,B
"Oliver, who owned the Rocking O Ranch in fee simple, died and left the property to his daughter, ""Melinda, her heirs and assigns; but if my son, Oliver Jr., is living 25 years from the date of my death, then to Oliver Jr., his heirs and assigns."" At the time of Oliver's death, Oliver Jr. was one year old. The common law Rule Against Perpetuities is unmodified in the jurisdiction. The grant in the will to Oliver Jr. is:","Valid, because the interest vests, if at all, within a life in being.","Valid, because it grants Oliver Jr. a reversionary interest.","Invalid, because the will grants Melinda the complete interest in the property, so there is nothing to be left to Oliver Jr.","Invalid, if this jurisdiction does not recognize a testator's ability to convey a possibility of reverter by will.",A
"Donna was arrested and taken to police headquarters, where she was given her Miranda warnings. Donna indicated that she wished to telephone her lawyer and was told that she could do so after her fingerprints had been taken. While being fingerprinted, however, Donna blurted out, ""Paying a lawyer is a waste of money because I know you have me."" At trial, Donna's motion to prevent the introduction of the statement she made while being fingerprinted will most probably be:","Granted, because Donna's request to contact her attorney by telephone was reasonable and should have been granted immediately.","Granted, because of the ""fruit of the poisonous tree"" doctrine.","Denied, because the statements were volunteered and not the result of interrogation.","Denied, because fingerprinting is not a critical stage of the proceeding requiring the assistance of counsel.",C
"A group of children, ranging in age from 8 to 15 , regularly played football on the common area of an apartment complex owned by O'Neill. Most of the children lived in the apartment complex, but some lived elsewhere. O'Neill knew that the children played on the common area and had not objected. Peter, a 13-year-old who did not live in the apartment complex, fell over a sprinkler head while running for a pass and broke his leg. Although Peter had played football on the common area before, he had never noticed the sprinkler heads, which protruded one inch above the ground and were part of a permanently installed underground sprinkler system. If a claim is asserted on Peter's behalf, Peter will:","Prevail, if the sprinkler head was a hazard that Peter probably would not discover.","Prevail, because O'Neill had not objected to children playing on the common area.","Not prevail, because Peter did not live in the apartment complex.","Not prevail, unless the sprinkler heads were abnormally dangerous to users of the common area.

"Jeffries was the chief of security for The Watervliet, a large, exclusive apartment complex. Most of The Watervliet's residents were quite wealthy, and Jeffries resented the fact that he had many responsibilities and received what he considered to be a paltry salary. Therefore, Jeffries was receptive when Garth told him that he would pay Jeffries $ 250$ if Jeffries would obtain a key to the apartment of Mrs. Wealthy and give the key to Garth. Mrs. Wealthy was an affluent and socially prominent widow who resided in The Watervliet. The next day Jeffries obtained a key to Mrs. Wealthy's apartment and gave the key to Garth. Garth handed Jeffries the $ 250$ in cash. Jeffries believed that Garth planned to use the key to take valuables from Mrs. Wealthy's apartment. In fact, Garth planned to pretend that he was a ""Good Samaritan"" returning a ""lost key"" to Mrs. Wealthy that Garth had fortuitously found in The Watervliet lobby. Garth felt that this ploy would gain him access to Mrs. Wealthy's apartment, where he planned to sell her a ""real estate limited partnership share"" in nonexistent Florida property. Garth's plan worked up to a point. He brought the key to Mrs. Wealthy, who thanked him and invited him into her apartment for afternoon tea and watercress sandwiches. Garth attempted to sell the ""limited partnership share"" to Mrs. Wealthy, but she quickly surmised that the limited partnership was bogus and politely asked Garth to leave. Garth, a resourceful chap, did not want his $ 250$ investment in the key to be a total waste of money, so he surreptitiously removed a small but valuable art deco bronze statuette from Mrs. Wealthy's foyer and left the apartment with it. 9. If Jeffries is arrested and appropriately charged with theft of the key and conspiracy to commit theft of the key, of what additional crime or crimes, if any, could Jeffries be charged and convicted? (A) Attempted false pretenses. (B) Conspiracy to commit burglary. (C) Larceny, conspiracy to commit burglary, and conspiracy to commit false pretenses. (D) None of the above. At Nick's trial, the prosecution seeks to introduce the cocaine into evidence against Nick. Nick's attorney objects. The court should rule the cocaine:","Admissible, because of the emergency conditions arising from the growing menace of drugs to the public.","Admissible, because, in consenting to the search of his luggage, Nick impliedly consented to a body search.","Inadmissible, because Sam had neither probable cause nor reasonable suspicion to search Nick.","Inadmissible, because Sam had no right to search the luggage.",B
"Harry and Wilma were going through a divorce proceeding and were contesting the value of their house. Harry, a real estate agent familiar with property values in the area, had personally prepared an appraisal shortly before commencement of the divorce proceedings. The appraisal document stated that the house was worth $ 200,000$. Nora, a next-door neighbor of Harry and Wilma's, had seen this appraisal document. During settlement negotiations, Harry maintained that the house was worth $ 180,000$. When negotiations proved to be fruitless, the parties proceeded to trial. At trial, Wilma called Nora to testify as to the value placed on the house in the appraisal document. Nora's only knowledge as to the house's value comes from having read the document. Harry's attorney objects. May Nora testify as to the value stated in the appraisal document?","Yes, because she has personal knowledge of the contents of the document.","Yes, if Harry has destroyed the document.","No, because the appraisal document is the best, and thus the only admissible, evidence.","No, because Nora's testimony would be inadmissible hearsay.",B
"The federal government has complete jurisdiction over certain park land located within the state of Plains. To conserve the wildlife that inhabits that land, the federal government enacts a statute forbidding all hunting of animals in the federal park. That statute also forbids the hunting of animals that have left the federal park and have entered the state of Plains. Hanson has a hunting license from the state of Plains authorizing him to hunt deer anywhere in the state. On land within the state of Plains located adjacent to the federal park, Hanson shoots a deer he knows has recently left the federal land. Hanson is prosecuted for violating the federal hunting law. The strongest ground supporting the constitutionality of the federal law forbidding the hunting of wild animals that wander off federal property is that:",This law is a necessary and proper means of protecting United States property.,The animals are moving in the stream of interstate commerce.,The police powers of the federal government encompass protection of wild animals.,"Shooting wild animals is a privilege, not a right.",A
"Brown suffered from the delusion that he was a special agent of God. He frequently experienced hallucinations in the form of hearing divine commands. Brown believed God told him several times that the local Roman Catholic bishop was corrupting the diocese into heresy, and that the bishop should be ""done away with."" Brown, a devout Catholic, conceived of himself as a religious martyr. He knew that shooting bishops for heresy is against the criminal law. $\mathrm{He}$ nevertheless carefully planned how he might kill the bishop. One evening Brown shot the bishop, who was taken to the hospital, where he died two weeks later. Brown told the police he assumed the institutions of society would support the ecclesiastical hierarchy, and he expected to be persecuted for his God-inspired actions. Psychiatrist Stevens examined Brown and found that Brown suffered from schizophrenic psychosis, that in the absence of this psychosis he would not have shot the bishop, and that because of the psychosis Brown found it extremely difficult to determine whether he should obey the specific command that he do away with the bishop or the general commandment ""Thou shalt not kill""; Brown was charged with murder. If Brown interposes an insanity defense and the jurisdiction in which he is tried has adopted only the M'Naghten test of insanity, then the strongest argument for the defense under that test is that:",Brown did not know the nature of the act he was performing.,Brown did not know that his act was morally wrong.,Brown did not know the quality of the act he was performing.,Brown's acts were the product of a mental disease.,B
"Egbert has died without having executed a will, and his rather substantial estate must be distributed by the probate court. The jurisdiction's applicable statute provides that where a decedent leaves neither issue nor spouse, nor parents, his estate goes to his brothers and sisters and their descendants. Egbert was never married, had no children, and both of his parents are dead. Tamara, whose birth certificate was destroyed by fire, seeks to establish that she is the daughter of Egbert's only sibling, Ethel, now also deceased. Tamara offers into evidence the statement in a trust instrument recorded pursuant to statute in the office of the county recorder (in which the original is kept). The instrument was executed by Egbert's father, Ethelbert, and recited that certain specified real property conveyed by Ethelbert into the trust should be held for the benefit of ""my devoted son Egbert and my beloved daughter Ethel and her loving daughter Tamara."" The document actually offered is an enlarged print photocopy of microfilm records, authenticated by an employee of the county. The trial court should:","Exclude the evidence, because it is not the best evidence.","Exclude the evidence, because it is inadmissible hearsay not within any recognized exception.","Admit the evidence, because it is a record of a document affecting an interest in property.","Admit the evidence, because it constitutes a past recollection recorded.",C
"Ohner holds title in fee simple to a tract of 1,500 acres. He desires to develop the entire tract as a golf course, country club, and residential subdivision. He contemplates forming a corporation to own and to operate the golf course and country club; the stock in the corporation will be distributed to the owners of lots in the residential portions of the subdivision, but no obligation to issue the stock is to ripen until all the residential lots are sold. The price of the lots is intended to return enough money to compensate Ohner for the raw land, development costs (including the building of the golf course and the country club facilities), and developer's profit, if all of the lots are sold. Ohner's market analyses indicate that he must create a scheme of development that will offer prospective purchasers (and their lawyers) a very high order of assurance that several aspects will be clearly established: Of the following, the greatest difficulty that will be encountered in establishing the scheme is that:","Any judicial recognition will be construed as state action which, under current doctrines, raises a substantial question whether such action would be in conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment.","The scheme, if effective, renders title unmarketable. ",One or more of the essential aspects outlined by Ohner will result in a restraint on alienation.,There is a judicial reluctance to recognize an affirmative burden to pay money in installments and over an indefinite period as a burden that can be affixed to bind future owners of land.,D
"Jackson and Brannick planned to break into a federal government office to steal food stamps. Jackson telephoned Crowley one night and asked whether Crowley wanted to buy some ""hot"" food stamps. Crowley, who understood that ""hot"" meant stolen, said, ""Sure, bring them right over."" Jackson and Brannick then successfully executed their scheme. That same night they delivered the food stamps to Crowley, who bought them for $ 500$. Crowley did not ask when or by whom the stamps were stolen. All three were arrested. Jackson and Brannick entered guilty pleas in federal court to a charge of larceny in connection with the theft. Crowley was brought to trial in the state court on a charge of conspiracy to steal food stamps. On the evidence stated, Crowley should be found:","Guilty, because, when a new confederate enters a conspiracy already in progress, he becomes a party to it.","Guilty, because he knowingly and willingly aided and abetted the conspiracy and is chargeable as a principal.","Not guilty, because, although Crowley knew the stamps were stolen, he neither helped to plan nor participated or assisted in the theft.","Not guilty, because Jackson and Brannick had not been convicted of or charged with conspiracy, and Crowley cannot be guilty of conspiracy by himself.",C
"A state statute provides that persons moving into a community to attend a college on a fulltime basis may not vote in any elections for local or state officials that are held in that community. Instead, the statute provides that for voting purposes all such persons shall retain their residence in the community from which they came. In that state the age of majority is 18 . Which of the following is the strongest argument to demonstrate the unconstitutionality of this state statute?",A state does not have an interest that is sufficiently compelling to justify the exclusion from voting of an entire class of persons.,There are less restrictive means by which the state could assure that only actual residents of a community vote in its elections.,Most persons moving to a community to attend college full-time are likely to have attained the age of majority under the laws of this state.,On its face this statute impermissibly discriminates against interstate commerce.,B
"When Esther, Gray's 21-year-old daughter, finished college, Gray handed her a signed memorandum stating that if she would go to law school for three academic years, he would pay her tuition, room, and board, and would ""give her a $ 1,000$ bonus"" for each ""A"" she got in law school. Esther's uncle, Miller, who was present on this occasion, read the memorandum and thereupon said to Esther, ""and if he doesn't pay your expenses, I will."" Gray paid her tuition, room, and board for her first year but died just before the end of that year. Subsequently, Esther learned that she had received two ""As"" in the second semester. The executor of Gray's estate has refused to pay her anything for the two ""As"" and has told her that the estate will no longer pay her tuition, room, and board in law school. In an action against Gray's estate for $ 2,000$ on account of the two ""As,"" if the only defense raised is lack of consideration, Esther probably will: ",Succeed under the doctrine of promissory estoppel.,Succeed on a theory of bargained-for exchange for her father's promise.,"Not succeed, because the $ 1,000$ for each ""A"" was promised only as a bonus.","Not succeed, because Esther was already legally obligated to use her best efforts in law school.",B
Lord leased a warehouse building and the lot on which it stood to Taylor for a term of 10 years. The lease contained a clause prohibiting Taylor from subletting his interest. Can Taylor assign his interest under the lease? ,"Yes, because restraints on alienation of land are strictly construed.","Yes, because disabling restraints on alienation are invalid.","No, because the term ""subletting"" includes ""assignment"" when the term is employed in a lease.","No, because even in the absence of an express prohibition on assignment, a tenant may not assign without the landlord's permission.",A

That same day, disinterested witnesses being present, she handed the passbook to Prodigal and said, ""As a token of my love and affection for you, I give you this $ 10,000$ savings account.""
