"The frequency of a particular allele in a population of 1,000 birds in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is 0.3. If the population remains in equilibrium, what would be the expected frequency of that allele after 500 years?",It will increase if the allele is favorable or will decrease if it is unfavorable for individuals in that population.,Not enough information is provided to determine if the frequency of the allele will remain the same or change.,The frequency of the allele will remain at 0.3 because the population is at Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.,The frequency of the allele will remain the same; this is an example of the bottleneck effect.,C
Which of the following statements is NOT correct about apoptosis?,"Apoptosis, a special type of cell division, requires multiple cell signaling.",The fact that apoptosis is widespread across several kingdoms is evidence that it evolved early in the evolution of eukaryotes.,Apoptosis plays a crucial role in the development of fingers in embryonic development.,Apoptosis prevents an aging and dying cell from damaging neighboring cells.,A
"More than a dozen species of Darwin's finches with various specialized adaptations inhabit the Gal치pagos Islands. Each species possesses a specialized adaptation for obtaining food. Why is it that similar adaptations do not exist among the finches of the South American mainland, the presumed origin of the Gal치pagos finch ancestor?",The various foods available on the mainland are different than those on the Gal치pagos Islands.,South American predators limited evolution of the mainland finch.,Reproductive isolation is not possible on the mainland.,The available niches that the Darwin's finches exploited on the Gal치pagos Islands were already occupied by other species of birds on the mainland.,D
Which of these is the smallest unit upon which natural selection directly acts?,a species' gene frequency,a population's gene frequency,an individual's genome,an individual's phenotype,D
"Many different fermentation pathways occur in different organisms in nature. For example, skeletal muscle cells convert pyruvate into lactic acid when no oxygen is present. Yeast cells can produce alcohol and carbon dioxide under the same circumstances. However, regardless of the specific reactions, the purpose of glycolysis is an important one. Which statement best describes the importance of glycolysis?",It produces large amounts of ATP by substrate level phosphorylation.,It reoxidizes NADH so that glycolysis can continue.,"It produces pyruvate, which is the raw material for oxidative phosphorylation.",It occurs in the cytoplasm.,B
"Before the human genome was sequenced by the Human Genome Project, scientists expected that they would find about 100,000 genes. In fact, they discovered that humans have only about 24,000 genes. How can we exhibit so many different traits from so few genes?",Modification of histone proteins usually increases the function of genes.,Epigenetics enables one gene to produce many different traits.,This is proof that pseudogenes and introns are expressed.,A single gene can produce more than one trait because of alternative splicing,D
"When driving from east to west in the U.S. from a forest ecosystem to grasslands, trees gradually give way to grasses. Which of the following is the critical factor responsible for this shift?",Amount of sunlight,Availability of oxygen,Availability of water,Length of growing season,C
"Catastrophism, meaning the regular occurrence of geological or meteorological disturbances (catastrophes), was Cuvier's attempt to explain the existence of",evolution.,the fossil record.,uniformitarianism.,the origin of new species.,B
The theory of evolution is most accurately described as,an educated guess about how species originate.,"one possible explanation, among several scientific alternatives, about how species have come into existence.",an opinion that some scientists hold about how living things change over time.,"an overarching explanation, supported by much evidence, for how populations change over time.",D
Villi and microvilli are present in the small intestine and aid in reabsorption by,increasing the surface area of the small intestine,decreasing the surface area of the small intestine,making the small intestine more hydrophilic,making the small intestine more hydrophobic,A
"Within a few weeks of treatment with the drug 3TC, a patient's HIV population consists entirely of 3TC-resistant viruses. How can this result best be explained?",HIV can change its surface proteins and resist vaccines.,The patient must have become reinfected with 3TC-resistant viruses.,HIV began making drug-resistant versions of reverse transcriptase in response to the drug.,"A few drug-resistant viruses were present at the start of treatment, and natural selection increased their frequency.",D
