"Two lists, list1 and list2, contain the names of books found in two different collections. A librarian wants to create newList, which will contain the names of all books found in either list, in alphabetical order, with duplicate entries removed.

 For example, if 1istl contains
 [""Macbeth"", ""Frankenstein"", ""Jane Eyre""]
 and 1ist2 contains
 [""Frankenstein"", ""Dracula, ""Macbeth"", ""Hamlet""],
 then newList will contain
 [""Dracula"", ""Frankenstein"", ""Hamlet"", ""Jane Eyre"", ""Macbeth""].

 The following procedures are available to create newList.
 Procedure
 Explanation
 Sort (list)
 Sorts list in alphabetical order and returns the resulting list.
 Combine (listl, list2)
 Creates a new list consisting of the entries from
 list1 followed by the entries from list2. The resulting list is returned.
 RemoveDuplicates (list)
 Iterates through list. If any two or more entries have the same value, the duplicate entries are removed so that any entry appears at most once. The resulting list is returned.

 Which of the following code segments will correctly create newList?","newList ← Combine (listl, list2)
 newList ← Sort (newList)
 newList ← RemoveDup1icates (newList)","listl ← Sort (listl)
 list2 ← Sort (list2)
 newList ← Combine (listl, list2)

A programmer is deciding between using a linear or binary search to find a target value in a sorted list. Which of the following is true?,"In all cases, a binary search of a sorted list requires fewer comparisons than a linear search.","Generally, the advantage of using a binary search over a linear search increases as the size of the list increases.",A linear search will generally run faster than a binary search because a linear search requires fewer lines of code to implement.,Using a linear search is preferable to using a binary search if there is a chance that the target may not be found in the list.,B
