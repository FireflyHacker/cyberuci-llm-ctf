"Deanna was moving to Russia to work in a foreign policy institute, and was in the process of moving out of the apartment that she had shared with Vanessa, who was not in at the time. Just before leaving, Deanna collected numerous items of hers from Vanessa's room that Vanessa had borrowed, usually without permission. As she was leaving the apartment, she grabbed what she believed to be her laptop computer, which Vanessa had often borrowed to do reports for work. Because it was an older, slower machine, she planned to trade it in for a different model at a computer resale store during a stopover in London. When she arrived at the computer store she discovered that she had taken a brand new, state-of-the-art laptop that Vanessa had apparently just purchased. Is Deanna guilty of larceny of the computer?","No, because she mistakenly believed that the computer she had picked up was hers.","No, if her mistake as to whose computer she had picked up was reasonable.","Yes, because she intended to permanently deprive Vanessa of the computer when she took it.","Yes, if she decides to keep the computer or trade it in for a different one.",A
"Gasco owns a storage facility where flammable gases are stored in liquefied form under high pressure in large spherical tanks. The facility was constructed for Gasco by Acme Company, a firm that specializes in the construction of such facilities. After the facility had been in use for five years, an explosion in the facility started a large fire that blanketed the surrounding countryside with a high concentration of oily smoke and soot. Farber owns a large truck farm near the facility. His entire lettuce crop was destroyed by oily deposits left by the smoke. If Farber asserts a claim against Gasco for the loss of his lettuce crop and is unable to show any negligence on the part of Gasco, will Farber prevail?","Yes, because the operation of the storage facility was an abnormally dangerous activity.","Yes, because the intrusion of the smoke onto Farber's farm amounted to a trespass.","No, if the explosion was caused by internal corrosion that reasonable inspection procedures would not have disclosed.","No, if the explosion was caused by negligent construction on Acme's part.",A
"Congress provides by statute that any state that fails to prohibit automobile speeds of over 55 miles per hour on highways within the state shall be denied federal highway construction funding. The state of Atlantic, one of the richest and most highway-oriented states in the country, refuses to enact such a statute. The best argument that can be made in support of the constitutionality of this federal statute is that:",The states conceded their authority over highways to the national government when the states accepted federal grants to help finance the highways.,The federal government can regulate the use of state highways without limitation because the federal government paid for most of their construction costs.,Reasonable legislators could believe that the 55 mile-per-hour speed limit will ensure that the federal money spent on highways results in greater benefit than harm to the public.,A recent public opinion survey demonstrates that $90 \%$ of the people in this country support a 55 mile-perhour speed limit.,C

"Plummer, a well-known politician, was scheduled to address a large crowd at a political dinner. Just as Plummer was about to sit down at the head table, Devon pushed Plummer's chair to one side. As a result, Plummer fell to the floor. Plummer was embarrassed at being made to look foolish before a large audience but suffered no physical harm. If Plummer asserts a claim against Devon for damages because of his embarrassment, will Plummer prevail?","Yes, if Devon knew that Plummer was about to sit on the chair.","Yes, if Devon negligently failed to notice that Plummer was about to sit on the chair.","No, because Plummer suffered no physical harm along with his embarrassment.","No, if in moving the chair Devon intended only a good-natured practical joke on Plummer.

"Oscar, the owner in fee simple, laid out a subdivision of 325 lots on 150 acres of land. He obtained governmental approval (as required by applicable ordinances) and, between 1968 and 1970 , he sold 140 of the lots, inserting in each of the 140 deeds the following provision: The Grantee, for himself and his heirs, assigns and successors, covenants and agrees that the premises conveyed herein shall have erected thereon one singlefamily dwelling and that no other structure (other than a detached garage, normally incident to a single-family dwelling) shall be erected or maintained; and, further, that no use shall ever be made or permitted to be made other than occupancy by a single family for residential purposes only. Because of difficulty encountered in selling the remaining lots for single-family use, in January 1971, Oscar advertised the remaining lots with prominent emphasis: ""These lots are not subject to any restrictions and purchasers will find them adaptable to a wide range of uses."" Payne had purchased one of the 140 lots and brought suit against Oscar to establish that the remaining 185 lots, as well as the 140 sold previously, can be used only for residential purposes by single families. Assuming that procedural requirements have been met, to permit adjudication of the issue Payne has tendered, which of the following is the most appropriate comment? ",Oscar should win because the provision binds only the grantee.,The outcome turns on whether a common development scheme had been established for the entire subdivision.,The outcome turns on whether there are sufficient land areas devoted to multiple family uses within the municipality to afford reasonable opportunity for all economic classes to move into the area so as to satisfy the standards of equal protection of the law.,"Payne should win under an application of the doctrine, which requires construction of deeds, to resolve any doubt against the grantor.",B
"Dr. Wally, a local physician who was prominent in the community and beloved by his patients, died suddenly of a heart attack. Wally was only 46 years old at the time of his death, and so the local newspaper, The Daily Bleat, had never prepared a ""pre-obituary,"" as it did for many prominent figures. Snoops, a reporter with The Daily Bleat, was assigned to write an obituary before the next day's edition went to press. Snoops talked briefly with Mary, Wally's widow, and then called State Medical School, from which Wally had always said he had graduated. As it was late in the afternoon, all the professors were out on the golf course; thus, Snoops spoke with Nina, a secretary in the office of the dean of the medical school. When asked about Wally, Nina replied, ""I don't think Wally ever graduated."" In Snoops's obituary, which appeared in the next morning's Daily Bleat, Snoops had written that Wally had never actually received a medical degree from State Medical School. Upon reading the obituary, Mary broke into tears and then became very angry, for she had worked hard to help put Wally through State Medical School, from which Wally had, in fact, graduated with high honors. Wally's executor, Eddie, was equally incensed. Both Eddie and Mary called The Daily Bleat, demanding a retraction. The next day, on the front page, The Daily Bleat admitted its error and stated that Wally graduated with high honors from State Medical School. They also fired Snoops. Nonetheless, both Eddie and Mary sued The Daily Bleat for defamation. What is The Daily Bleat's best defense?",There was no malice on the part of the defendant.,The newspaper's retraction negated any harm.,Snoops got his information from a secretary at the Medical School.,Wally is dead.,D
"Henry hated Wanda, his former wife, for divorcing him and marrying John a short time thereafter. About a month after Wanda married John, Henry secretly entered Wanda and John's rented apartment during their absence by using a master key. Henry placed a microphone behind the bookstand in the bedroom of the apartment and drilled a hole in the nearby wall, with the result that the microphone appeared to be connected with wires going into the adjoining apartment. Actually, the microphone was not connected to anything. Henry anticipated that Wanda would discover the microphone in a few days and would be upset by the thought that someone had been listening to her conversations with John in their bedroom. Shortly thereafter, as he was putting a book on the stand, John noticed the wires behind the bookstand and discovered the hidden microphone. He then called Wanda and showed her the microphone and wires. Wanda fainted and, in falling, struck her head on the bookstand and suffered a mild concussion. The next day John telephoned Henry and accused him of planting the microphone. Henry laughingly admitted it. Because of his concern about Wanda and his anger at Henry, John is emotionally upset and unable to go to work. If Wanda asserts a claim against Henry based on infliction of mental distress, the fact that John was the person who showed her the microphone will:","Relieve Henry of liability, because John was careless in so doing.","Relieve Henry of liability, because John's conduct was the immediate cause of Wanda's harm.","Not relieve Henry of liability, because Henry's goal was achieved.","Not relieve Henry of liability, because the conduct of a third person is irrelevant in emotional distress cases.",C
"Delbert had his laptop computer stolen from his office during a recent holiday weekend. He went to Alice's computer resale shop to find a replacement and saw what he mistakenly thought was his computer. He questioned Alice, who told him that someone had just sold her the computer a few days ago, but she refused to give him any information on the seller and would not let him inspect it more closely. That night, after the shop was closed, Delbert forced open the back door and took the computer. Alice's clerk, who lived in an apartment above the shop, heard someone breaking in and called the police. Delbert was apprehended a block away from the building. If Delbert is charged with burglary in a jurisdiction retaining the common law criminal offenses, which of the following facts will be most relevant in determining his guilt or innocence?",His mistake as to the identity of the computer was not reasonable.,He was unaware that there was an apartment above the shop and did not believe that anyone lived in the building.,He realized that the computer was not his before he carried it out.,None of the above facts are relevant. ,B
"Innes worked as a secretary in an office in a building occupied partly by her employer and partly by Glass, a retail store. The two areas were separated by walls and were in no way connected, except that the air conditioning unit served both areas and there was a common return-air duct. Glass began remodeling, and its employees did the work, which included affixing a plastic surfacing material to counters. To fasten the plastic to the counters, the employees purchased glue, with the brand name Stick, that was manufactured by Steel, packaged in a sealed container by Steel, and retailed by Paint Company. In the course of the remodeling job, one of Glass's employees turned on the air conditioning and caused fumes from the glue to travel from Glass through the air conditioning unit and into Innes's office. The employees did not know that there was common ductwork for the air conditioners. Innes was permanently blinded by the fumes from the glue. The label on the container of glue read, ""DANGER. Do not smoke near this product. Extremely flammable. Contains Butanone, Toluol, and Hexane. Use with adequate ventilation. Keep out of the reach of children."" The three chemicals listed on the label are very toxic and harmful to human eyes. Steel had received no reports of eye injuries during the 10 years that the product had been manufactured and sold. If Innes asserts a claim against Paint Company, the most likely result is that she will:",Recover if she can recover against Steel.,"Recover, because Innes was an invitee of a tenant in the building. ","Not recover, unless Paint Company was negligent.","Not recover, because the glue came in a sealed package.",A
"State Blue has a statute making it a crime to operate a motor vehicle while intoxicated. State Blue has another statute providing that a blood alcohol level of 10 raises a presumption of intoxication. State Blue police spotted Billy Bob's pickup weaving from lane to lane on the highway and they stopped the truck. Billy Bob took a breathalyzer test that indicated a $.12$ blood alcohol level, and so Billy Bob was charged with operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated. At trial, at the close of all the evidence, and over Billy Bob's objection, the judge instructed the jury: ""If you are convinced that, at the time Billy Bob was pulled over, his blood alcohol level was 10 or greater, you must presume that he was intoxicated."" Billy Bob was convicted, and he is appealing on the ground that the judge's instruction was improper. The appellate court should:","Affirm, because the judge may instruct the jury on the law, and he merely cited the state statute. ","Reverse and remand, because the jury should have been left to draw its own conclusion without the judge's instruction.","Reverse and remand, because the presumption might lead the jury to believe that the prosecution did not have to meet its burden of proving Billy Bob guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.","Reverse and remand, because the instruction was substantially more prejudicial than probative.",C
"Lonny owned Gold Acre, a 40-acre tract of land improved with a one-story house. Lonny leased Gold Acre to Truman for a 15-year period. After five years had expired, the government condemned 15 acres of the property for road construction and allocated the compensation award to Lonny and Truman according to the respective interest so taken. It so happened, however, that Truman had used the 15 acres taken by the government to store vehicles necessary in Truman's work. Truman knew of no other place nearby where he could store the vehicles. There is no applicable statute in the jurisdiction where the property is located, nor any provision in the lease relating to the condemnation. Truman quit possession, claiming that he could no longer live in the premises if he could not park the vehicles needed in his work close to where he lived. Lonny brought suit against Truman to recover rent. The most likely result of this suit is that Lonny will:","Prevail, because the relationship of landlord and tenant was unaffected by the condemnation, thus leaving Truman still obligated to pay rent.","Prevail, because of the implied warranty on the part of the tenant to return the demised premises in the same condition at the end of the term as they were at the beginning.","Not prevail, because there has been a breach of the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment by Lonny's inability to provide Truman with possession of the whole of the property for the entire term.","Not prevail, because there has been a frustration of purpose that excuses Truman from further performance of his contract to pay rent.",A

At trial, Potts, who personally supervised all of the work, seeks to testify to what he remembers about the amount of pipe used, the number of workers used on the job, and the number of hours spent grading. Dennis objects on the ground that Potts had routinely recorded these facts in notebooks which are in Potts's possession.

Dwight's business was quite successful, and he was making good profits from the store's operation when he underwent a religious conversion and decided that the true meaning of life was not to be found in the quest for material success.

"Philip was a 10-year-old boy. Macco was a company that sold new and used machinery. Macco stored discarded machinery, pending sale for scrap, on a large vacant area it owned. This area was unfenced and was one-quarter mile from the housing development where Philip lived. Macco knew that children frequently played in this area and on the machinery. Philip's parents had directed him not to play on the machinery because it was dangerous. One day Philip was playing on a press in Macco's storage area. The press had several wheels, each geared to the other. Philip climbed on the largest wheel, which was about five feet in diameter. Philip's weight caused the wheel to rotate, his foot was caught between two wheels that were set into motion, and he was severely injured.

"After several years in the planning, Jason was ready to begin building his dream house. To save money, he decided to act as the general contractor and hire all of the subcontractors himself. He hired separate contractors for the foundation, the frame, the electricity, the plumbing, and the masonry. After several months of work, the house was finally ready for occupancy. The first night that Jason stayed there, however, a fire swept through the house. Jason managed to escape with a broken ankle and some minor burns, but the house was a total loss. An investigation by the fire marshal established that the fire started from a short in some wiring behind a wall. A small section of wiring that ran to an outlet through a narrow gap between a furnace chimney and a hot water pipe had had part of its outer sheath cut off. Both the chimney and the pipe had been installed, and the walls put up, after the rough wiring had been completed. Jason filed suit against Shortstop Electrical Service, the contractor that did the rough wiring. The parties stipulated that Shortstop had installed the wiring in compliance with the detailed blueprints that Jason had drawn up, and that the wiring had been inspected and approved by the building inspector shortly after it had been installed. At trial, Jason introduced the report of the fire marshal establishing the above facts and evidence of his medical expenses and other damages. At the end of Jason's case, Shortstop's attorney rested her case and moved for a directed verdict. Jason's attorney also moved for a directed verdict. How should the court rule on the directed verdict motions?","Deny both directed verdict motions, because Jason has presented enough evidence to submit the case to the jury.","Deny Shortstop's motion and grant Jason's motion for a directed verdict, because Shortstop failed to rebut the presumption of negligence that Jason has established.","Deny Jason's motion and grant Shortstop's motion for a directed verdict, because the wire could have been damaged by another contractor.","Deny Shortstop's motion and grant Jason's motion for a directed verdict, because a short in the wiring caused Jason's injuries.
